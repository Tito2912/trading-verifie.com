<h2>1. Fees and commissions</h2>
<p>Fees are an essential criterion, especially for regular investors. Here's what you need to know:</p>
<h3>eToro</h3>
<p>eToro offers <strong>100% commission-free stock trading</strong>, provided you don't use leverage. No brokerage fees, no management fees. Spreads are present on cryptos and CFDs. Additional fees include:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5 withdrawal fee</li>
<li>Currency conversion if deposit not in USD</li>
<li>Inactivity fee after 12 months</li>
</ul>
<h3>XTB</h3>
<p>XTB doesn't charge commissions on stocks and ETFs, up to €100,000 monthly volume. Beyond that, 0.2% fees are applied. CFDs have variable spreads, and there are no withdrawal fees. XTB is known for its transparent fee policy.</p>
<h3>DEGIRO</h3>
<p>DEGIRO charges €0.50 + market fees per stock transaction (e.g.: 0.04% on Euronext). "Free" ETFs are limited to a selection. No minimum deposit, no withdrawal fees, but a rather technical pricing grid to read. No hidden spreads, but watch out for automatic exchange fees.</p>
<h2>2. Available products</h2>
<p>Each platform covers a different range of financial instruments:</p>
<h3>eToro</h3>
<p>A wide and balanced offering:</p>
<ul>
<li>US, European, Asian stocks</li>
<li>ETFs, indices, commodities</li>
<li>Cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, ADA...)</li>
<li>CFDs on forex, commodities and indices</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideal for diversified investors and those who want to explore the crypto market.</p>
<h3>XTB</h3>
<p>XTB offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>CFDs on stocks, indices, commodities, forex</li>
<li>Real stocks and ETFs since 2021</li>
</ul>
<p>Cryptos are only available as CFDs. It's not possible to buy real BTC or ETH.</p>
<h3>DEGIRO</h3>
<p>DEGIRO focuses on listed securities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stocks (US, EU, Asia)</li>
<li>ETFs, bonds, derivatives (options, futures)</li>
</ul>
<p>No crypto, no CFDs. DEGIRO remains a "long-term investor" platform rather than a trading tool.</p>
<h2>3. Interface, tools and user experience</h2>
<h3>eToro</h3>
<p>eToro shines through its <strong>simplicity and social aspect</strong>. The interface is designed for beginners, with intuitive navigation. CopyTrading is integrated, with possibility to filter by performance, risks or portfolio type. Charts are simple but sufficient. The "community" aspect brings real added value to learn by exchanging with other investors.</p>
<h3>XTB</h3>
<p>XTB offers a robust platform, with <strong>xStation 5</strong>, ideal for more experienced traders. Many technical indicators, price alerts, economic calendar and analyses are available. The interface is professional, but requires a steeper learning curve. Excellent for swing trading or CFD strategies.</p>
<h3>DEGIRO</h3>
<p>The DEGIRO interface is more austere. It goes straight to the point, without frills. It's purely functional logic, without CopyTrading or advanced chart tools. Ideal for "buy &amp; hold" investors who know what they want to buy. No social or educational module.</p>
<h2>4. Regulation and security</h2>
<p>It is imperative to ensure that the chosen platform respects current regulations and protects your funds:</p>
<h3>eToro</h3>
<p>eToro is regulated by several financial regulatory authorities:</p>
<ul>
<li>CySEC (Cyprus)</li>
<li>FCA (United Kingdom)</li>
<li>ASIC (Australia)</li>
</ul>
<p>Client funds are separated, and a robust security system is in place, with 2FA and protection against attacks.</p>
<h3>XTB</h3>
<p>XTB is also well regulated, notably by KNF (Poland) and FCA. Accounts are separated, and the trading environment is safe. Tools like guaranteed stop-loss are available.</p>
<h3>DEGIRO</h3>
<p>DEGIRO is regulated in the Netherlands, via the Financial Markets Authority (AFM) and DNB. Although DEGIRO doesn't offer default 2FA account protection, funds are well separated in an independent entity.</p>
<h2>5. Mobile application and accessibility</h2>
<h3>eToro</h3>
<p>The eToro mobile application is rated among the best on Android and iOS. Fluid, ergonomic and 100% functional. You can follow your portfolios, copy traders or place your orders in a few clicks.</p>
<h3>XTB</h3>
<p>xStation Mobile is very powerful, but slightly more technical. It's more suited to active traders. It allows real-time analysis, customizable charts and fast trading.</p>
<h3>DEGIRO</h3>
<p>The DEGIRO app is simple and minimalist. Perfect for checking positions or placing basic orders. No advanced features, but effective for managing a long-term portfolio.</p>
<h2>6. Community, support and training</h2>
<h3>eToro</h3>
<p>With its integrated social network, eToro offers a unique approach: portfolio sharing, news feeds, discussions between investors. Ideal to progress together. Customer support is available 24/7 by ticket, in multiple languages.</p>
<h3>XTB</h3>
<p>XTB stands out with its <strong>free online training</strong>: videos, webinars, eBooks. Support is efficient and responsive. A real asset for serious beginners or technical traders.</p>
<h3>DEGIRO</h3>
<p>DEGIRO remains limited on this aspect: few educational content, little community, little interaction. Customer support by email or phone, rather slow compared to competition.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: which platform to choose?</h2>
<p>It all depends on your profile:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beginner or versatile investor</strong> → <strong>eToro</strong> ✅</li>
<li><strong>Active trader, oriented technical analysis</strong> → <strong>XTB</strong></li>
<li><strong>Passive investor, long-term oriented</strong> → <strong>DEGIRO</strong></li>
</ul>
