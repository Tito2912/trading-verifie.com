<h2>Start Stock Market Investing with eToro: Independent Guide to Invest in 2025</h2>
<p>Dream of making your money work? Learning to invest in stocks, cryptos, or commodities without spending hours? This guide is for you. Thanks to eToro, investing has never been so simple. Follow this guide step by step to understand, create your account and take your first steps in financial markets.</p>
<h2>1. Why invest in 2025?</h2>
<p>The stock market is no longer reserved for professional traders or banks. In 2025, individuals have access to intuitive and low-cost platforms. With inflation, low rates and economic uncertainties, placing your money intelligently has become essential.</p>
<p>Investing allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow your savings</li>
<li>Protect your purchasing power</li>
<li>Prepare projects (travel, real estate, retirement)</li>
<li>Generate passive income</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Why choose eToro to start?</h2>
<p>eToro is the ideal platform for beginner investors. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intuitive interface</strong>: even without experience, everything is guided.</li>
<li><strong>No commission on stocks</strong></li>
<li><strong>Possibility to copy experienced traders (CopyTrading)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Complete mobile application</strong></li>
<li><strong>Regulation and security</strong>: your funds are protected</li>
</ul>
<p>And especially: you can start with small capital from €50.</p>
<h2>3. Create your account in 5 minutes</h2>
<p>The first step is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the official website:  
        <a href="https://med.etoro.com/B217_A126072_TClick_Setoro-landing.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">click here to register</a>.</li>
<li>Fill in your personal information (email, password, country).</li>
<li>Validate your email (a link will be sent to you).</li>
<li>Complete the KYC form (mandatory for European regulation).</li>
<li>Deposit funds via credit card, transfer or PayPal.</li>
</ol>
<p>💡 Tip: you can test the interface in "demo account" mode without any risk.</p>
<h2>4. Understand available assets</h2>
<p>eToro offers a wide range of financial assets accessible to beginners:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stocks</strong>: Amazon, Apple, Tesla, etc. (real or via CFD)</li>
<li><strong>ETFs</strong>: diversified stock portfolios (ex: SP500)</li>
<li><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong>: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Forex</strong>: currency trading like EUR/USD</li>
<li><strong>Commodities</strong>: gold, oil, silver</li>
</ul>
<p>Each asset carries a risk level. eToro displays a risk indicator on 10 to help you decide. Never invest in an asset you don't understand.</p>
<h2>5. Place your first order</h2>
<p>Once your account is funded, you can invest in a few clicks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose an asset (for example, Apple stock)</li>
<li>Click on "Invest"</li>
<li>Indicate the desired amount</li>
<li>Set (if you wish) a stop loss or take profit</li>
<li>Validate your order</li>
</ol>
<p>💡 You can invest fractionally: no need to buy 1 full stock at €300, you can invest only €20.</p>
<h2>6. Manage risks effectively</h2>
<p>Trading involves risks. Here are some tips to limit your losses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Systematically use a <strong>stop loss</strong></li>
<li>Never put all your capital on a single asset</li>
<li>Start small, test, learn</li>
<li>Never trade under emotion (panic or euphoria)</li>
<li>Keep a clear strategy: short term or long term?</li>
</ul>
<p>eToro also offers a "Statistics" section on each asset with volatility data, analysis, charts, and user sentiment.</p>
<h2>7. Track your performance</h2>
