<h2>Why eToro is the best trading platform to start with in 2025</h2>
<p><em>Ease of use, zero commission on stocks, CopyTrading, intuitive interface… eToro stands out as the ideal platform for beginner traders. Here's why.</em></p>
<h2>A platform designed for beginners</h2>
<p>Getting started with trading can seem intimidating: technical jargon, multitude of assets, complex tools… This is exactly where eToro makes all the difference. From registration, the experience is smooth, guided and designed for users who have never traded before.</p>
<h3>Simple and quick registration</h3>
<p>In a few clicks, you create your account with integrated identity verification (KYC). Once connected, you immediately access a demo account with $100,000 virtual money to practice risk-free.</p>
<h3>Clear and intuitive interface</h3>
<p>Unlike other platforms where information overload can be discouraging, eToro offers a visually clear interface. The dashboard is clean, each asset has a detailed sheet, and all functions are accessible in a few clicks: buy, sell, copy, watchlists, history, etc.</p>
<h2>A secure and regulated environment</h2>
<p>When starting with trading, security is paramount. eToro is regulated by several major financial authorities, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CySEC</strong> (Cyprus) for the European Union</li>
<li><strong>FCA</strong> (United Kingdom)</li>
<li><strong>ASIC</strong> (Australia)</li>
</ul>
<p>These regulations guarantee compliance with strict standards regarding transparency, client fund protection and responsible financial practices.</p>
<p>European users' deposits are, for example, protected up to €20,000 by the Cypriot investor compensation fund.</p>
<h2>Unbeatable fees for beginners</h2>
<p>An element often overlooked by new investors is the weight of fees. On some platforms, you can pay up to €5 in fees per transaction, which can quickly eat into your profits. eToro stands out with a very competitive policy:</p>
<h3>0% commission on stocks</h3>
<p>eToro allows you to buy real stocks with no commission. No purchase fees, no custody fees. If you invest long-term in companies like Tesla, Amazon or Total, you'll pay nothing to buy or hold.</p>
<p>This makes the platform very attractive for beginners who want to start with small amounts without fees reducing their capital.</p>
<h3>Transparent fees</h3>
<p>All fees are clearly displayed on product sheets. For cryptocurrencies, for example, eToro applies a spread, but again, no surprises: everything is listed transparently in the interface.</p>
<h2>CopyTrading™: learn while investing</h2>
<p><strong>CopyTrading</strong> is one of eToro's flagship features, attracting many beginners. It's a system that allows automatically copying the portfolios and movements of the platform's best traders.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>You browse a catalog of investor profiles with their historical performance, risk level, type of assets they trade (crypto, stocks, forex…), their average holding period, etc. With one click, you can invest an amount (e.g.: €100) to copy all their trades in real time.</p>
<h3>A powerful educational tool</h3>
<p>By copying an experienced trader, you follow their movements and receive notifications about their decisions. This helps understand investment logic, learn by observing, and train without spending hours analyzing markets.</p>
<h3>A solution to generate passive income</h3>
<p>CopyTrading is also an excellent way to generate semi-automated returns, provided you select serious, consistent and well-rated profiles. You can always stop, withdraw your funds or change copied trader at any time.</p>
<h2>An integrated learning center</h2>
<p>For those who wish to train in parallel, eToro provides a veritable <strong>trading academy</strong> online. You'll find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive courses for beginners and intermediates</li>
<li>Live webinars hosted by experts</li>
<li>Explanatory articles on strategies, risk management, technical or fundamental analysis</li>
<li>Quizzes and educational videos</li>
</ul>
<p>These contents are accessible directly from the interface, at no extra cost. This makes eToro not only a trading platform, but also a true evolving learning tool.</p>
<h2>A complete and fluid mobile application</h2>
<p>In 2025, being able to manage your investments at any time is essential. eToro understood this well and offers an ultra-fluid mobile application, available on iOS and Android. It allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consult your portfolios and performance in real time</li>
<li>Place buy or sell orders with one click</li>
<li>Follow your copied traders live</li>
<li>Read integrated economic news</li>
<li>Access history and all statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>Its ergonomics are refined and designed mobile-first. It allows keeping an eye on your investments in all circumstances.</p>
<h2>A real investor community</h2>
<p>What still distinguishes eToro from many other platforms is its social aspect. Each asset and each trader have an interactive news feed where users can comment, ask questions and exchange.</p>
<p>You can follow other members, react to their analyses, and even publish your own reflections to get feedback. This community dimension transforms the user experience and breaks the isolation often associated with trading.</p>
